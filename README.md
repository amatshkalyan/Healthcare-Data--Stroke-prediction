Stroke Data Analysis and Prediction using Machine Learning
This project explores stroke data from the Kaggle Stroke Prediction Dataset. The analysis aims to highlight the key patterns and trends among patients who have suffered a stroke, based on demographic, lifestyle, and medical data. Additionally, this project introduces machine learning models to predict stroke risk, leveraging Python‚Äôs data science libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

üìä Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of various patient features such as:

Age
Gender
Hypertension
Heart Disease
Smoking Status
BMI (Body Mass Index)
Average Glucose Levels
Our goal is to identify key factors associated with stroke risk and later apply machine learning models to predict stroke occurrence based on these factors.

üßë‚Äçüíª Methodology
The project is divided into two key parts:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conducted in-depth analysis using Python libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation and Seaborn for visualizations.
The analysis focused on visualizing the relationships between stroke occurrence and key health indicators.
A clear trend is observed in factors such as heart disease, age, and hypertension, indicating higher stroke risks in older patients and those with pre-existing health conditions.
Key Code Snippets:
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load and clean the dataset
df = pd.read_csv("healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv")
sns.kdeplot(df['age'], shade=True)
# Further analysis done with plotting other factors
Visualizations:

The above visualizations reveal clear distinctions in the health profiles of stroke vs non-stroke patients. For example, non-smokers and younger individuals exhibit a lower risk of stroke, while those with hypertension or heart disease show increased vulnerability.

2. Machine Learning Models for Prediction
In the next phase of the project, I will apply machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to predict stroke risks based on patient data.
I will split the data into training and testing sets, perform feature engineering, and evaluate model performance using common metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
üîç Final Results
The exploratory data analysis provides significant insights into the key factors influencing stroke risks. Moving forward, machine learning models will be trained on these features to predict the likelihood of stroke for future patients. The aim is to assist healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk patients early, enabling preventive measures and better health outcomes.
